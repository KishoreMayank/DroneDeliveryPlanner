Implemented an efficient motion planning algorithm to determine an optimal protocol for sending out 10 life-saving drones to 20 hospitals in Rwanda and Ghana with a max stall time of 529 seconds (order placed to drone shipped) 

Download the repository and run the python file to see the scheduled drones and the packages that they are holding. Follow along on ZipScheduler.py to understand how the code works and how you can manipulate it to understand the efficiency of this motion planning algorithm.
